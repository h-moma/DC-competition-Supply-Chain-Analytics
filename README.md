# DC-competition-Supply-Chain-Analytics

The main purpose of this data analysis is to help company (JIT) solve key shipment and inventory management challenges, analyze supply chain inefficiencies, and create an insightful dashboard to inform business stakeholders about potential problems and propose structural business improvements. 

## Summary and Findings

JIT business activity has shown a significant decline in the year 2017, with total shipments dropping, as well as gross sales. Monthly inventory levels also drastically decreased in 2017, meanwhile the inventory cost showed no significant change from the previous years, which indicates slow-moving inventory. The percentage of shipments arriving on-time is only 52%, which indicates that almost half of shipments experience delay. First-class shipping mode showing the most significant delay. Further analysis revealed that the latest shipments occured with the most ordered products, with first-class shipping being a popular option. Popular products also tend to have longer warehouse fulfillment days, this explains the high delay in shipments for these products regardless of shipping mode. Moreover, shipments dispatched from USA warehouse are significantly higher than those from Puerto Rico warehous. According to these findings, I recommend the following as possible solutions:
- A more even distirbution of inventory among warehouses will reduce overall high fulfillment and transit times.
- Utilize forecasting to align inventory levels with expected demand, which will reduce inventory costs and shipping delays.
- Consider reducing warehouse fulfilment time for popular products to better meet shipping demands.
